# Personal Portfolio Website – Google Docs Style ✍️

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, uniquely designed in the **style of Google Docs**! This project showcases a multi-page personal website with a clean, document-like aesthetic, interactive features, and even a mini-game. It’s built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and light **Bootstrap**, and hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

## 📄 About This Project

This project consists of four pages:
1. **About Me** – A dynamic page with a profile image, interactive greeting, and resume-style layout.
2. **Interests & Hobbies** – Features fun emoji-based interactions and describes my passions outside of work.
3. **CS50x Course Review** – A brief review of my experience with Harvard's CS50x course, featuring color-randomized text and accordion-style Q&A.
4. **Contact Me** – A contact form combined with a custom-built mobile-friendly Snake game. You can only message me after winning the game!

All pages maintain a consistent, clean Google Docs-inspired layout with a side menu for seamless navigation.
