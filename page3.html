      <h1>CS50x Course Review</h1>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="colorize">
        I first became acquainted with CS50 at university. Since I live in Iran and we have limited options
        for financial transactions with the world, good courses are rare. One of the best has always been
        Harvard University’s CS50 course. This online course is free and offers top-notch educational quality,
        and you can sign up for it right now by visiting the CS50 website.
      </p>

      <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
      <p class="colorize">
        This course is fundamental in nature. That’s why the first week of the course (Week 0) starts with Scratch.
        The course spans 10 weeks (11 weeks including Week 0), with each week featuring its own problem set, and the
        videos are available on YouTube and the course website. After mastering Scratch, you will learn the C
        programming language thoroughly. Then, you will be introduced to deep concepts such as algorithms, data structures,
        and memory. In the final weeks, SQL, Python, Flask, and web development will be taught. Ultimately, you will need
        to submit a final project. Although I haven’t managed to submit my final project yet, I believe the certification
        for this course is completely free.
      </p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p class="colorize">
        Even though I completed this course after graduating and obtaining my bachelor's degree, and even after taking the
        entrance exam for my master's program, I highly recommend enrolling in this course. Throughout this course, I faced
        challenging exercises that changed my perspective on the world of computers, especially regarding the C programming
        language. After experiencing this course, I will be even more eager to learn. The creativity involved in solving the
        exercises and learning new concepts makes this course a strong and unmatched experience.

          <div class="accordion-content colorize">
            It's very simple! By visiting the CS50x website (visitable in link section), you can access this course. I should also mention that this course has
            been translated into various languages. For example, CS50x Iran is the Persian-speaking representative of this great course.

          <button class="accordion-btn">Why is this course called CS50x?</button>
          <div class="accordion-content colorize">
            Initially, this course (or at least I think so) focused solely on the fundamentals of computer science.
            However, now there are other courses like CS50 Web, CS50 Python, CS50 Cyber Security, and CS50 AI being
            offered in the same format.

            Well, I should mention that I created this page as a practice for the Home Page in Week 8 of the CS50x course
            in 2025. I did this with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation, as well as guidance from chatbots
            like Claude and ChatGPT.
