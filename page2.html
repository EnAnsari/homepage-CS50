                Outside of my digital academic world, life continues to flow.
                I have a deep passion for reading philosophical books and novels.
                I believe literature possesses a unique beauty that you can't find
                anywhere else. My interest in philosophy, like many other enthusiasts,
                began with a few simple yet unanswered questions. One thing I've
                come to realize is that, alongside the undeniable impact of technological
                advancement on modern life, the progress of philosophy and the humanities
                has served as a foundational growth platform for technology. Without it,
                humanity might still be stuck in a primitive, stagnant state.
            </p>
            <p>
                I‚Äôve had a strong passion for problem-solving since childhood. From the
                very beginning, my favorite subject in elementary school was math, and
                this interest led me to choose a math major in high school. However,
                when I entered university, I realized that mathematics was merely a
                means to satisfy my addiction to solving problems. When I discovered
                programming, I encountered a new realm of solvable problems, and my
                enthusiasm for tackling them grew even more, especially since these
                challenges felt more tangible in the real world. In university, I became
                familiar with ICPC and IOI, and my journey of problem-solving continues to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to problem-solving, another topic that fascinates me is the diversity
                of cultures. You might find it interesting to know that right now, as you read
                this text, many people in places far from you are living entirely different lifestyles.
                They speak different languages, eat foods that might seem unimaginable to you, and
                have cultures that differ from your own. Many of your values may hold different
                meanings for them. This curiosity has fueled my passion for exploring distant lands.
                Although this interest sparked in my childhood, my more serious steps toward this
                journey began recently, in my final year of undergraduate studies, when I made a committed
                decision to study English as the world's primary language. I started this journey with
                English language learning apps, especially Duolingo, and it continues to this day. I
                believe that if you find yourself at a crossroads in this journey or are hesitating,
                just take the plunge and enjoy both the journey and the destination to the fullest.

                I‚Äôd like to touch on another aspect from my childhood. As psychologists often say, all issues
                have their roots in early experiences. Fortunately, this isn‚Äôt a problem for me. (I should
                mention that I spent a year interacting with psychology students at university.) My passion
                for science and cutting-edge technology has always been undeniable. Some of my favorite programs
                and even cartoons were scientific or perhaps even science fiction. I would wake up early just
                to catch documentaries about planets, and I always kept my general scientific knowledge at the
                highest level possible. However, during my childhood, I struggled with a lack of resources
                since the internet wasn‚Äôt as accessible as it is today, leading me to read the same books
                multiple times. These experiences now serve as motivation for my interest in high-tech projects
                and my fascination with wild scientific ideas. Perhaps this is why I find myself captivated by
                the creativity in defining concepts when watching shows like Black Mirror or Love, Death & Robots.
                I feel the same excitement when I see code that embodies beauty and creativity akin to that of
                renowned masterpieces. If you share this passion, then I‚Äôd like to say, hello, my dear friend!
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final section, I‚Äôd like to talk about my sports activities. As a non-physical sport,
                I have a strong passion for chess and I‚Äôm always looking to improve my skills. Additionally,
                I‚Äôve been fond of cycling since childhood. I‚Äôve always dreamed of exploring the world on a
                bicycle, and I can honestly say I‚Äôm in love with it. Beyond that, I used to enjoy early morning
                walks, but my motivation waned as the streets near my home became emptier. I‚Äôve decided that if
                I ever become independent or migrate, I‚Äôll pick this activity back up. I also enjoy hiking,
                which is a more intense activity than walking or running. I make it a point to conquer the
                mountains we visit for leisure. The reward of witnessing a beautiful view at the end, along
                with the joy of expending energy, makes it all the more appealing to me. Lastly, I want to mention
                water sports. Although I‚Äôm not a professional swimmer, I love being in the water. Can you feel the
                tranquility that comes from weightlessness in water? I should also note that I haven‚Äôt tried many
                sports yet. As a saying goes, maybe we could even win an Olympic medal in a few of them :D
            </p>
